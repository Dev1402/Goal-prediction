# Goal-prediction
Expected goals is a method for estimating the quality of chances that a football team creates or concedes in a match. This is the thing I like a lot about xG. It may take a lot of data crunching to create specific xG values, but the underlying idea makes football sense. How many good chances did a team create?

The current method includes factors such as distance to goal, angle to goal, the type of pass that assisted the shot (cross / throughball / etc), the type of shot (header / foot / other body part), the type of play that leads to the shot (set play / counterattack / established possession) as well as a variety of other factors.
